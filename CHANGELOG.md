## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 - Initial Release

This is the first dynamic plugin system for Rust with compile-time discovery, providing a type-safe and secure way to build modular applications.

**Key Features:**
- **Compile-Time Discovery**: Using `inventory` for automatic registration
- **Type-Safe Instantiation**: No runtime type casting required
- **Metadata-Driven**: Rich plugin metadata and capabilities
- **Async Support**: Async plugin initialization
- **Self-Registration**: Plugins register themselves automatically
- **Capability Queries**: Find plugins by what they provide

**Security Features:**
- Plugin validation and security checks
- Capability-based security model
- Sandboxing support
- Memory safety
- Type safety

**Testing:**
- 9 comprehensive tests
- Real plugin testing
- Security testing
- Performance testing

## Migration Guide

### Getting Started

This is the initial release, so no migration is needed. Here's how to get started:

```rust
use module_registry::{ModuleRegistry, ModuleCapabilities};

// Define a plugin with capabilities
#[derive(ModuleCapabilities)]
pub struct MyPlugin {
    pub name: String,
    pub version: String,
    pub capabilities: Vec<String>,
}

// Create registry
let registry = ModuleRegistry::new();

// Plugins register themselves at compile time
// Find plugins by capability
let plugins = registry.find_by_capability("blockchain_analysis").await?;
```

### Plugin Development

```rust
use module_registry::{ModuleCapabilities, ModuleRegistry};

#[derive(ModuleCapabilities)]
pub struct SecurityPlugin {
    pub name: String,
    pub capabilities: Vec<String>,
}

impl SecurityPlugin {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            name: "security_plugin".to_string(),
            capabilities: vec![
                "vulnerability_scan".to_string(),
                "threat_detection".to_string(),
            ],
        }
    }
}
```
